# ENGLISH Questions:


#Can you cd into the temp directory?

Yes you can cd into the temp directory by typing 
'cd temp' into the command line
However you are going to have to be within the path that the temp directory was made.
In this case we would have to make sure we were within the Chapter_5 directory.
We would then type the 'cd temp' and it would take you into the temp directory.  If
you were unsure of what your options are within the chapter_5 directory you would
just type the command 'ls'  and it would list your options.
And in this case  "readme.md" and "temp" would be an option to select from.

# Why don't we go into the temp directory?

You could go into the temp directory if you wanted, as of right now though we dont
have any documents in the temp directory.  so if we typed 'cd temp' while we
were in the Chapter_5 directory it would put us in there but that is where the 
path ends right now. We would know this because if we typed the command 'ls' now. 
it wouldnt list anything else.


# Can you go to the slash temp directory?

Yes you can. You would make sure you were on the path of...

cd ~/workspace/davinci_coders_t1_2016 
 then You would type    :
 
'cd chapter_5/temp'

and this would take you within the temp directory within the chapter_5 directory.


# Can you go to the slash temp slash log directory?

You could do this if you made sure that you made the directory log
while you were in the directory "temp". To do this you would type the command:
 
'mkdir log'     
This would create a directory called "log" within the directory "temp" which is
within the directory "chapter_5".

So in order to go to the slash temp slash log directory you would make sure your path
was already on   
cd ~/workspace/davinci_coders_t1_2016
and then you would type in
'cd chapter_5/temp/log'
and you would now be in the directory log   :)
