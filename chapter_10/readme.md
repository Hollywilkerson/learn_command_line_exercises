'cp foo.txt tmp'

then you will do an 'ls' command to see your options, the directory "tmp" 
should be an option then change directories into the "tmp" directory you made, by typing 
'cd tmp'
now type
'ls' 
this will list the foo.txt file copy inside the "tmp" directory. 

##Can you copy .bash_profile in your home directory to the current directory?
