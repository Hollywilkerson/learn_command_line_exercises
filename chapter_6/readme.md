'ls' lists out the contents of the directory you are currently in. While you are in a 
 directory you can type in the command 'ls' and it will list whatever is within that directory
 It will list off which directories are available to go to next.  Whenever you are lost
 you can type in 'pwd', which will tell you what directory you are currently in, and then
 you type 'ls' and you can see the list of options for what path you want to take next.

Which I created a temp directory within the chapter_6 directory. So it looks like 
this on my command line...

cd ~/workspace/davinci_coders_t1_2016/chapter_6
 
From the chapter_6 directory we could type
 'ls' and it will list off our options. In this case our
options are "readme.md" and "temp". We will switch to the temp folder by typing in the command 
'cd temp'
now we are in the directory named "temp".  In order to see what's inside the temp directory 
we will type the command
 'ls'
this will list off the options within this directory.Right now our options within 
the "temp" folder is "log".
so we could cd to the log directory if we wanted by typing
'cd log'
